# Angular_Pizza_order
We want to develop a small web app that allows users to order pizza.  First of all we'll display the list of pizzas with ingredients and prices. Data will be loaded from server/pizzas.json.  When the user chooses something from the list the order summary will update dynamically.  There will be a button to confirm the order. An ajax call will be performed to server/order.json and the result will be displayed as a message like this: "Your order will be delivered in x minutes".  You can use any library/framework/plugin you want.  If you can display discounts for pizzas it's a plus
